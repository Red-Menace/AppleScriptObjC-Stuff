# AppleScriptObjC Stuff

Some scripts and resources for usage with AppleScriptObjC / Cocoa-AppleScript projects:

* Scripts - stand-alone sample and example scripts.
* UI Objects - a collection of scripts to create various UI objects (windows, buttons, etc).
* Xcode 13 templates - Since Xcode 14 no longer includes AppleScriptObjC project templates, here are the application and Automator action templates from Xcode 13.
